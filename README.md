I'm Mohamed Elshahawi, pronounced MOH-HAH-med EL-SHAH-hah-wee. I was born and raised in Egypt, and I moved to the United States :us: over seven years ago. I came here pursuing eduction and to explore what the US has to offer. I enjoy writing code and solving problems. I graduated Summer 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering, and I'm looking for a great team to join and learn from.

I recently concluded an internship with a promising startup; in my internship, I worked on the following:

* Developed a Speech-to-Text module for real-time conversation captioning.
* Integrated a Sound-Classification TensorFlow model into the system.
* Developed modules for drawing output onto displays using I2C peripheral and HDMI interface.
* Wrote automation scripts for building and deploying software on multiple architectures. 

I'm seeking a full-time role as a Software Engineer. More job experiences can be found on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mnshahawy) page. Please, feel free to [contact me](mailto:contact@elshahawi.dev) if you're looking for a problem solver, a quick learner, and a team player to join your team.
