I'm Mohamed Elshahawi, pronounced MOH-HAH-med EL-SHAH-hah-wee. I enjoy writing code and solving problems. My most recent role is MTS Software Engineer at Salesforce, inc. 

At Salesforce, I was part of Service Email team which owned all email-related features in Service Cloud. Here's a quick overview of my work with Service Email:

*	Led an epic to combine string-based and header-based email threading for Email-to-Case. The feature aims at eliminating duplicate Case records for Email-to-Case, which account for about 30% of all records.
*	Designed a new string-based threading mechanism that lives up to a higher security standard.
*	Improved header-based threading performance by more than 25% with refactoring and using efficient SQL query.
*	Facilitated resolving a long-standing customer request to eliminate duplicate attachments for Email-to-Case. 
*	Acquired valuable product metrics to drive implementation decisions. Derived metrics from 11 gigabytes of logs by creating a pipeline to clean the logs, extract data, and process the data.
*	Accelerated delivering a feature integrating Email-to-Case with Gmail and Outlook over REST APIs to address the needs of major customers.
*	Created a command-line testing utility for the team. The tool cuts down testing time by more than 80% and enabled testing of never-tested-before edge cases.
