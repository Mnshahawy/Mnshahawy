I'm Mohamed Elshahawi, pronounced MOH-HAH-med EL-SHAH-hah-wee. I was born and raised in Egypt, and I moved to the United States :us: little over seven years ago. I came here pursuing eduction and to explore what the US has to offer. I enjoy writing code and solving problems. I'm graduting next December, and I'm looking for a great team to join and learn from.

Many of my repos are set to private, but I have complied a list, below :arrow_down:, of coding samples from school and work.
